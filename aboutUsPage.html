                        We have defined this project in our team and successfully developed <span class="text-orange"><strong>Splitter</strong></span> mobile threaded-chat application with the aim of improving the conversations in mobile app worlds. With the belief of improving the communication at all levels, we managed to delegate the tasks according the team-member’s skills and knowledge and availability and help each other deliver the project.

                        "One of the most important things we want to achieve is delivering an app with a clear overview of chats, contacts and messages. Therefore, I have worked on creating lists with custom cells so that information was easily accessible by the user. In addition, I created a customizable color theme for the app which gives the app a savory look. I have worked on the overall UI of the app and programmed in XAML most of the time. Finally, I have created presentations to make sure SplitChat comes across as a successful project."

                        "During this project there was a perfect chemistry in the team. The communication was good and everybody took their part. I have especially looked at the mvvm pattern, the opening part of the app and making the website. The difference in level of programming skills was big so some of us had to catch up with tutorials. I'm the most satisfied with my part with the welcome page, login page and sign up part."

                        "At the start of the project I was involved with the ideation of the app. Then I helped turn the abstract idea into a concrete app design. When we started the development of the app I served as an architect, creating the fundamentals for it. I served as the Lead Developer, delegating tasks so everybody could be involved, while working myself on front-end implementations."

                        "Firstly, I worked on the backend. This facilitates the communication and data exchange between the different clients. Secondly, I worked on the app itself (the frontend) to make sure it cooperates well with the backend. Lastly, I worked on some other client side improvements and bugfixes, such as the functionality behind pages and fixing bugs that caused deployment issues."
